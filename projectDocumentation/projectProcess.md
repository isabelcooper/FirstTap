# Project process

## Overview
- Sprint planning of upcoming tasks based on rough user stories. 

- Key tasks stored on kanban board and updated over the course of the week with checkin on progress against goal each morning (quasi stand up)

_NB I would normally work on a whiteboard which is a little more visually obvious than the spreadsheet - if I were to repeat it, I'd bring a massive piece of paper and postits!_
