    <h3>How we use your personal data</h3>
    <p>
        Your contact information will only be used for communications relating directly to your account such as validating pincode resets when this feature is released). <br>
        First Catering Ltd does not currently store your transaction history; only the running balance per employee.
        <br> <br>
        First Catering Ltd will never exchange, sell or transfer your data to any other company without your consent for any reason beyond delivering the service requested. Your data will not be made available to any party outside of the authorized team.
        We reserve the right to update our privacy policy at any time; updates will be available on this page. By using our service, you consent to this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h3>Ensuring your account cannot be accessed</h3>
    <p>
        Only the designated kiosks have the required access tokens to interact with the API.
        <br> <br>
        A user must be logged in to access or amend their balance - no purchases will be possible without logging in.
        While a single tap allows immediate log out, a user will be logged out of the service if they are inactive for 5 minutes.
