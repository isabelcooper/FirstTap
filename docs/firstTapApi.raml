      Welcome to the FirstTap API, your seamless payment system for employees at Bows F1.

      NB this system does not take payment itself, it simply stores a user's balance and payments against their record.
      The API must always be accessed using the provided login credentials in auth headers to ensure that only the designated kiosks have access.

      Individual user logins also generate session tokens which will expire after 5 minutes.

        **Store a new employee in the FirstTap system**

        This assumes a unique id for each user and stores them in the system DB.
        Core employee data is required and the route will fail if values are missing from the body.

        The employee name and a usage token valid for 5 minutes will be returned. This must be included in the headers of all further API calls.

        **Known limitations**
        - This is not configured to use any specific currency
        - The datastore allows 2 decimal places and figures up to 8 digits (so max Â£999999.99).

        Should this prove insufficient, please contact us for an extension.
